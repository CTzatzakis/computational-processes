pi - The circumference of a circle is found with the formula C=πd=2πr. Thus, pi equals a circle's circumference divided by its diameter.

Monte Carlo - Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
